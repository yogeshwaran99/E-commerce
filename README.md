This project is a full-stack e-commerce application developed with Java and Spring Boot for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and React for the frontend. The application supports role-based access control (RBAC) with JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication and authorization. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage products. The application provides functionality for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting products, with user roles such as CUSTOMER and VENDOR ensuring proper access and control over these operations. The React-based frontend communicates securely with the backend, providing a seamless user experience in managing an online store.
